	No one tells it like it is quite like David Corn, with his incisive insights and iron-clad allegiance to the facts to back it all up.

<p>
	<strong>And we're <em>thrilled</em> to launch a new offering, <em>This Land </em>by David Corn</strong>, for <em>Mother Jones </em>readers who tell us they want more of his essential work. Up to three times a week, <em>This Land </em>subscribers will receive his exclusive, uncensored thoughts on the big issues of the day&mdash;and you know it will be unlike any other email you receive.
</p>
<p>
	<em>This Land </em>is also a big experiment for us: Quality journalism like David's, and the rest of our team's, doesn't materialize from thin air (like a lot of the crap you see online or on TV) and the media, including <em>Mother Jones</em>, is facing ever-stiffer funding headwinds.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Sign up today for a free month and when your trial expires, we'll ask you to pay $5 a month to keep receiving the stories others are missing or won't touch, and no-holds-barred analysis, that only David can provide</strong>.
